Welcome to this React / node.js demo...

This app is a web-based React app using Node.js for a small api.



To install please run 
`npm install`

To run the production build please use
`npm start`

To run the dev build with hot reloading and nodemon to monitor changes to the api build run
`npm run start:dev`

Thanks for taking the time to look at my code.
